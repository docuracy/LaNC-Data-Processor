# ***Locolligo***: Geodata Curator
A single-page, browser-based javascript application to facilitate the formatting, linking, and geolocation of datasets, with a particular focus on Cultural Heritage. It employs standards developed by the [Pelagios Network](https://pelagios.org/), and will conform datasets for use in the Network's *Peripleo* map visualisation software.

* Active demonstration of prototype at https://docuracy.github.io/Locolligo/
