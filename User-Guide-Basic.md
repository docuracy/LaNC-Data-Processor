# Basic User Guide
> This User Guide will take you through the steps required to generate a location-based dataset that you can see mapped in *Peripleo*. The linking of features to other web-resources is explained in the [Advanced User Guide](./User-Guide-Advanced.md)

## CSV Columns
*This step is not essential, but it will make things easier later in the process.*

## Upload CSV
1. Point your browser to https://docuracy.github.io/Locolligo/ (*right-click this link to avoid losing your place in this Guide*).

## Download Dataset
There are two options for 'downloading' your dataset to your local filesystem (although in fact it is already held and processed locally in your device's memory):
1. Click on `Download` to save the file in JSON format.
2. Click on `CSV` to convert your dataset to CSV format (Comma Separated Values, as used by spreadsheet software).

> **CSV download needs to be rewritten to capture entire JSON object structure, together with annotation headings.**

> **Documentation yet to be completed.**
