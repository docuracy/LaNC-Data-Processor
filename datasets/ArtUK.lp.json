The Gallery continues to acquire works of art, often with the assistance of grant-aid bodies, with the aim of encouraging  the present and the future visitor to understand,  empathise with and feel part of the story of one of the greatest cities in the world.\n\nNotable paintings in the collection include John Singleton Copley’s enormous 'Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782', William Logsdail’s 'The Ninth of November, 1888', and  Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s  'La ghirlandata'.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/guildhallartgallery"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/collection_photos/COL_GAG_collection_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/ucl-art-museum","uuid":"ucl-art-museum-3457","properties":{"title":"UCL Art Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1339602,51.5245789],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>UCL Art Museum is situated in a traditional Print Room at the heart of UCL.

Its strengths are its Old Masters, work by James McNeill Whistler, and Scottish art.\n\nThe Hunterian, Scotland’s oldest public museum, was established through the bequest of William Hunter (1718–1783). The first Hunterian Museum opened in 1807 moving in the 1870s to new University buildings in the west of the city. In 1980 the art collections were provided with the purpose-built Hunterian Art Gallery at the centre of the campus.\n\nHunter’s collection is a rare survival of an eighteenth-century picture cabinet and includes masterpieces by Jean-Baptiste Siméon Chardin, Philips de Koninck, Rembrandt, George Stubbs and Frans Snyders. The unrivalled Whistler collection is centred on the artist’s estate and includes student work, nocturnes, seascapes, street views, and portraits. The Whistler Collection is complemented by the extensive Whistler archive in the University Library, works by followers, and Impressionist paintings by Eugène Louis Boudin, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Henri Fantin-Latour, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley. Scottish art from the nineteenth century to the present is well represented with important works by William McTaggart; the Glasgow Boys; Scottish Colourists; and subsequent generations, including Joan Eardley, Robin Philipson, Paolozzi (sculpture) and Christine Borland (medium other than oil).\n\nIn all, the collection numbers some 900 paintings, of which 190 displayed in the Gallery, and around 250 around the campus. The art collection is not just about paintings. The print collection, the largest in Scotland, numbers some 40,000 works from the fifteenth century to the present. There is also the pre-eminent holding of the work of C. R. Mackintosh, including the interiors from his Glasgow home. The Hunterian also collects sculpture.

The new museum opened in the basement of the Art Gallery in October 1907.\n\nThe 52 oil paintings in the Wrigley Gift represent the most successful and prominent artists of Wrigley’s day and include Edwin Henry Landseer's 'A Random Shot', John Constable's 'Hampstead Heath' and George Clausen's 'Spring Morning: Haverstock Hill'. However 'Calais Sands at Low Water: Poissards Collecting Bait' by J. M. W. Turner is undoubtedly a highlight of the collection. Successive curators have added to Wrigley's legacy. There are twentieth-century paintings by artists such as Victore Pasmore and Edward Burra (watercolours), while the establishment of a picture purchase fund has allowed the collection to continue to develop into the twenty-first century. The current focus is on acquiring high-quality recent art, often commissioning work directly from the artist, rather than attempting to fill any perceived gaps in the existing collection.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"buryartmuseum.co.uk"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/BAM_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/","uuid":"tullie-house-museum-and-art-gallery-6105","properties":{"title":"Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.9395521,54.8953193],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery was established by Carlisle Corporation in 1893.

His painting 'The Forge' is one of the few in art history which depicts the Victorian workplace fuelling the Industrial Revolution and is even rarer for having been painted by a smith.

A few nineteenth-century foreign artists are represented including Rosa Bonheur, Eugène Joseph Verboeckhoven and Julien Gustave Gagliardini.

The present house, designed by a local gentleman-architect, Colonel James Moyser, was built for Sir Rowland Winn (1706–1765), 4th Bt, and was further modified by James Paine between the mid-1730s and mid-1760s. Sir Rowland Winn (1739–1785), 5th Bt, commissioned Robert Adam to complete the interior, with plasterwork by Joseph Rose the younger, inset paintings by Antonio Zucchi and the furniture by Thomas Chippendale. Nostell Priory now contains one of the most important collections of pieces by the eighteenth-century English cabinetmaker to remain in the setting for which it was designed.\n\nHaving completed his education in Switzerland, the 5th Baronet married Sabine d'Hervart, the daughter of Baron Jacques Philippe d’Hervart, Governor of Vevey. Numerous paintings from the Swiss family’s collection were sent to Nostell following the death of Sabine's mother, Baroness d'Hervart in 1779. The picture valued most highly by the Winn family over the centuries, however, was Rowland Lockey's large painting, signed and dated 1592, of 'Sir Thomas More and His Family', a copy of Hans Holbein the younger’s destroyed group portrait.  \n\nThese were purchased in 2002 subsequent to Nostell Priory having been given to the National Trust in 1953 and after the furniture and some of the paintings were transferred in lieu of tax in 1986.

Nonetheless, Hardwick Hall has always had pictures and is the oldest collection in the British Isles – other than parts of the Royal Collection – still in situ. The will drawn up in 1601 by its builder ‘Bess of Hardwick’, Elizabeth (c.1527–1608), Countess of Shrewsbury, enumerates 89 pictures, virtually all portraits.\n\nBy the time of Bess’s descendent William Cavendish (1748–1811), 5th Duke of Devonshire, many of the portraits had lost their identities. A combination of knowledge of the 1601 inventory, the desire to have portraits of significant ancestors, and a lack of understanding of art or costume history, led to a number of them being inscribed with wrong and often impossible identities. The 5th Duke’s son William Cavendish (1790–1858), 6th Duke of Devonshire, actively loved and cherished Hardwick and employed Crace to restore the interiors and furnishings. He also introduced pictures and furniture from his other houses, such as Chatsworth, Chiswick House and Bolton Abbey, and essentially gave Hardwick the appearance it has today.\n\nThe estate, park, and house, including most of its historic contents were, after long negotiations, accepted in lieu of tax after the death of Edward Cavendish (1895–1950), 10th Duke of Devonshire, and transferred to the National Trust via the National Land Fund in 1959.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hardwick/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/HARD_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk","uuid":"dorich-house-museum-4856","properties":{"title":"Dorich House Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.262266,51.4336444],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Dorich House Museum, the former studio and home of the Estonian Sculptor Dora Gordine (1895–1991), holds a major collection of Gordine’s oil paintings, a small part of her oeuvre during her long career from the early 1920s to the early 1960s.

In 1974, Local Government Reorganisation resulted in the transfer of the collections to Copeland Borough Council. The museum collections were displayed in the Old Market Hall in 1975 and were later relocated to the Civic Hall's Dunboyne Hall in 1987 where it remained until 1996 when the purpose-built Beacon was completed on the Harbour front. The Beacon and its associated Resource Centre are now the permanent homes for Copeland's Museum Collection. \n \nFollowing a complete refurbishment in 2007, The Beacon is now equipped with new storage areas for its fine art collections, new thematic displays throughout, a refurbished Harbour Gallery for temporary and touring exhibitions and has seen many artefacts exhibited for the first time following a major programme of conservation work. \n \nThe fine art collection numbers 1,173 items and given the coastal location of Whitehaven, it is not surprising that some of the collection gems relate to maritime art. It includes an important group of maritime paintings featuring nationally and internationally renowned marine artists such as Joseph Heard who lived and worked in Whitehaven before moving to Liverpool in 1832, and Whitehaven-born Robert Salmon.\n \nThe collection also includes paintings by Oliver Ussison Hodgson, Willem van Diest, John Bousfield, William Mitchell, William Horde Yorke, Bernard McWilliams and G. Welsh.\n \nOther key pieces include paintings by Matthias Read, especially 'A Bird's Eye View of Whitehaven', 1736. The family portrait of Christian How with her children by James Cranke (Senior) is also a popular painting with our visitors.\n \nApproximately 10 per cent of the art collection is currently on display.

Works by George Marston depict Shackleton’s ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–1917.

This small boat, the 'James Caird', was used to effect the rescue of the crew stranded on Elephant Island in the Southern Ocean after the expedition ship 'Endurance' was crushed in the pack ice.\n\nThe Museum is reliant on charitable donations, gifts and sponsorship.

It also contains some pieces by old masters, including Jan Breughel the elder, Bartolomeo Neroni, Abel Grimmer, Jan van Scorel, Bartholomaeus Bruyn the elder and Cornelis de Zeeuw, as well as some later acquisitions. The paintings are dispersed around the College and are for the most part not on public display, but can be accessed for academic study.

The original aim was to provide a low-cost Oxford education for promising students of limited means. Bishop Francis James died in 1928. St Peter's thus became a memorial to this much-loved evangelical Bishop, who was the inspiration and prime-mover behind the building of Liverpool Cathedral, and its second Bishop. Sufficient supporters rallied to a memorial appeal launched by his son to raise £150,000 to build student accommodation and modify existing buildings. A frenetic building programme enabled the University Vice-Chancellor to licence St Peter's as a Permanent Private Hall. Thus in 1929 St Peter's Hall was born with 40 students. In 1947, now with 120 students, the Hall was granted the status of 'New Foundation', a significant step in the process of becoming a College.

The new foundation occupied the premises of the medieval Durham College which had been dissolved in the Reformation. Thomas Pope’s intention that Trinity would be a training ground for Catholic priests was soon overturned as the early members were forced to adapt to Protestantism under Queen Elizabeth. As the centuries have passed the college has evolved steadily, becoming in turn a pillar of the Anglican establishment in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; a centre of educational reform in the nineteenth; and a thriving part of Oxford University today. The very first oil paintings acquired by Trinity College were copy portraits of the Founder, Sir Thomas Pope, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Pope, which were purchased for the College Hall in about 1612. From this humble beginning has grown a significant collection of portraits that reflect the changing faces and lives of successive generations of the college community. By the end of the nineteenth century Trinity was actively commissioning paintings of Presidents and distinguished and long-serving fellows, and this tradition continues today, often with the assistance of the Trinity Society alumni association.

In accordance with the charitable aims of the College, which is a private institution, we are including our paintings on this website to widen public awareness and for the benefit of scholarship.\n\nThe College welcomes enquiries about its collections from scholars and any other bona fide researchers, which should be addressed to the Fellow for Chattels, timothy.wilson@balliol.ox.ac.uk. Arrangements for viewing should be made through the Domestic Bursar’s office: bursars.secretary@balliol.ox.ac.uk. Our paintings are hung throughout the College, many in the Hall which is regularly open to visitors, but others in Fellows’ rooms and in other locations to which there is not normally public access, and the College, which is an educational institution working the year round, is unable to guarantee access at all times.

Some of the paintings from Blathwayt’s collection were put up for auction in 1765. Colonel George William Blathwayt (1797–1871) ensured the survival of the remaining pictures when he inherited Dyrham in 1844. He also added to the collection, notably purchasing five ceiling paintings by Andrea Casali, originally painted for William Beckford of Fonthill Splendens. Dyrham and some of its contents were purchased by the Ministry of Works through the National Land Fund and transferred to the National Trust in 1956. </p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dyrham-park"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/DYP_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/charlecote-park/","uuid":"national-trust-charlecote-park-5453","properties":{"title":"National Trust, Charlecote Park"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.6159912,52.2040774],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Charlecote Park, home of the Lucy family for over 700 years, is where, allegedly, the young William Shakespeare was caught poaching the deer of Sir Thomas Lucy I, who was later caricaturised as Robert Shallow in 'The Merry Wives of Windsor'.

St Catharine’s has benefitted from two major bequests. In the 1740s it received a collection of 14 family portraits from Mary Ramsden. This introduced female portraits, unusual at that time, as it was not until 1979 that women were admitted as undergraduates.

Since our foundation we have lacked the wealth to compete with our royal neighbours at Trinity and King's Colleges for great works of art. A number of paintings tell the story of the College through portraits of a succession of notable Fellows and Masters. One such painting is of Sir John Lyons by John Bellany, who was artist in residence. He collaborated with our Fellow and eminent surgeon, Sir Roy Calne, whose own painting 'Mr Sloots and Mr Wright having Tea' captures a friendly moment between two respected members of staff, while his portraits of Shaun Wylie and Thaddeus Mann (Fellows, friends and colleagues) are enjoyed by visitors. Unfortunately the college has lacked a collection of contemporary works, so over the past eight years we have built up a collection of modern paintings by local artists such as Tess Recordon and Charlotte Cornish, in addition to works by Hughie O’Donoghue, following exhibitions of their work in the College. The dramatic paintings by Martin Bloch (on loan from the family foundation) are much admired by our students, but the painting that is perhaps most enjoyed by visitors to the College is the 'Degree Day' by Robert Farren, a large canvas which captures a Cambridge scene outside the Senate House on that special day in 1863.\n\nIt is stressed that that the paintings at Trinity Hall are not in public ownership. In accordance with the charitable aims of the College, which is a private institution, its collection is included on this website to widen public awareness and for the benefit of scholarship. The paintings are hung throughout the College, mainly in private areas.

Following the Norman invasion in 1066, there had always been a Baron in Kendal who was effectively the law in the town. The last Baron, Sir William Parr, (Brother of Katherine Parr) had lost his titles and lands some years before and this left a void in Kendal with no one in authority. The granting of this charter, which is still kept in the Town Hall and in remarkable condition, solved this problem. This facilitated the start of the collection, as Kendal now had the right to have various regalia, namely two silver Maces and a town seal. A subsequent Charter from Charles I in 1636 which superseded the Elizabeth charter, added the right, for the first time, to have a town Mayor and Kendal has had one ever since. They were entitled to have a new town seal, featuring a portrait of Charles and Kendal also was given the right to have a Sovereign Sword, one of only 47 towns in the country to have this honour. Since then the collection has just kept growing.\n\nThe Aldermen and Mayors of Kendal, at that time, comprised of wealthy and important businessmen from the local area, who commanded a special social status and respect. The names of the early Mayors are like a ‘Who’s Who’ of Kendal’s history and features all the major powerful families, many of who are still around today. Many of these Mayors would leave a legacy to the Town Hall following their term of office such as silverware or other objects of value. By the mid-1700s it became the custom for Mayors to have their portraits painted (in oil) and hung in the Town Hall for posterity. This heralded the start of the pictures collection and the earliest one still surviving is a miniature of William Gurnal, Mayor of Kendal in 1752.\n\nSubsequent Mayors continued the trend and so the collection grew. Over the years various benefactors also contributed paintings of local importance, such as influential citizens, local members of Parliament, and other town and church officials. By far the most valuable are a number of George Romney paintings and sketches which includes his first ever commission, ‘a hand holding a letter ‘which was used to show the location of the post box in the King’s Arms Hotel. His study of ‘King Lear in the Tempest’ is on display in the Abbot Hall Art Gallery and his ‘Kendal Sketchbook’ is on show in the Mayor’s Parlour in the Town Hall. George was not a Kendal man but he did his apprenticeship here before moving to London to further his career.\n\nOther donations to the collection continued for many years right up into the twentieth century and not only included oil paintings but many watercolours and prints from well known artists, notably some of the ‘Heelis’ (Beatrix Potter) collection following her death. Currently, the whole collection of paintings and artifacts consist of over 500 items and is kept primarily in the Town Hall and features regularly in public exhibitions and displays.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.kendaltowncouncil.gov.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/CBR_THK_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/seaton-delaval-hall/","uuid":"national-trust-seaton-delaval-6709","properties":{"title":"National Trust, Seaton Delaval"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.4964564,55.0821574],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Seaton Delaval Hall, with its vertiginous spiral staircases and the striking interior of its central hall, was commissioned from the Baroque architect, John Vanbrugh, by Admiral George Delaval (1668–1723).

With its once busy port nearby, under the ownership of Sir John Hussey Delaval (1728–1808), Seaton Delaval played a large part during the industrial revolution. It was also famous for its large-scale elaborate family amateur dramatics by the ‘gay Delavals’ – the children of Captain Francis Delaval (1692–1752) and the heiress Rhoda Apreece.\n\nThe last legitimate Delaval, Edward, died in 1814, when the house and estates passed to Sir Jacob Henry Astley (1756–1817), 5th Bt, of Melton Constable. It was his descendant, Edward (1912–2007), 22nd Baron Hastings, and his wife, Catherine, who made the house what it is today, restoring the fabric of the building, regenerating the gardens, and reassembling much of the collection, which had hitherto been dispersed to the other Delaval estates. Their son, Delaval (b.1960), 23rd Baron, has worked closely in collaboration with the National Trust, aided by a public appeal, acceptance in lieu of tax, and the Art Fund, to secure Seaton Delaval and its major contents for the nation, with greatly increased public access and involvement in 2009.\n\nThe collection includes paintings by Arthur Pond (1700–1758), the Delaval children, and local artists, like Thomas Bardwell, John Theodore Heins Senior, an émigré from Germany, whose depiction of 'A Music Party at Melton Constable' is notable, and from Newcastle, the little-known provincial painter, William Bell.

Another portrait of her by de Troy is at Powis Castle (National Trust).

A legend grew up in the 1380s that we were really founded even earlier, by King Alfred in 872, and, understandably enough, became widely accepted as the truth. Nowadays, however, William of Durham is accepted as Univ’s true founder, but that still gives us a claim to be the oldest college in Oxford or Cambridge. Univ began life as a small and poor College, with enough funds to support just four Fellows reading Theology. The earliest undergraduates had to pay their own way, but towards the end of the century the College found benefactors to endow undergraduate scholarships. Such scholarships were important ways of helping boys from middling to poor backgrounds to better themselves. As Univ slowly grew in size and wealth, work began in 1634 to replace its medieval buildings with a new Front Quad, paid for with gifts from many Old Members. Although half the new Quad was finished by 1640, it took almost 30 years to complete the remainder, because of the Civil War. The College was luckier with its other main quadrangle, Radcliffe Quad, built in only three years, 1716–1719, thanks to a bequest from one Old Member, John Radcliffe, whose statue can be seen there. In the eighteenth century, Univ became one of the most intellectually active Colleges in Oxford: former students and Fellows could be found in senior positions in the government and the judiciary. \n\nIt is stressed that the paintings at University College are not in public ownership.

Around these ‘hubs’ a diverse range of related displays present works which anticipated, challenged or responded to these four major movements. Moving back and forwards in time, these displays reflect the ongoing dialogue between past and present and suggest contemporary perspectives for approaching and reassessing the past.\n\nTate Modern is open to the public every day of the year except 24, 25 and 26 December.

It was sold in 1838 to the wealthy draper James Morrison (1789–1857), MP. In partnership with the dealer William Buchanan, Morrison put together one of the most distinguished painting collections in Britain in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, although most of it has, unfortunately, since been dispersed. \n\nThe newspaper proprietor Edward Iliffe (1877–1960), 1st Lord Iliffe, purchased the Basildon Park in 1928 with the intention of annexing his own estate at Yattendon. Having little interest in the mansion, it was quickly sold, with a much smaller parcel of land, in 1929 to George Ferdinando who, at one point, hoped to export the whole house to America but the Depression intervened and only some parts were dismantled.

Women painters are represented by a small charming painting of Maria Cosway, attributed to her husband Richard Cosway, and a portrait of an unknown woman attributed to Mary Beale. Mary Beale worked as a professional portrait painter from 1670 and wrote and propounded the equality of the sexes in friendship and marriage. Thus she is a fitting woman to have represented on the walls at Chawton, drawing together in her life many recurring themes from the main print collections at Chawton House.\n\nThe Knight Collection of paintings has recently been added to with the hanging of a large portrait of Jane Austen’s brother, Edward Austen Knight. Portraits of his descendants hang elsewhere in the house, including his son, Edward, who made his home at Chawton House from 1826, and his grandson, Montagu, who was a friend of Lutyens and bought the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement to Chawton.\n\nChawton House is over four hundred years old, and the recorded history of the land on which it stands stretches even further back.

Among the resulting pictures is 'The Bridge of Beauty', a view of the pre-industrial Taff valley with William Edwards’ bridge at Pontypridd in the distance. This bridge had been hailed as the first in Europe to exceed the span of the Rialto in Venice. Ibbetson was told that Pontypridd means ‘bridge of beauty’. It doesn’t; that would be ‘Pontprydd’. Close, but not close enough. Pontypridd is a contraction of ‘Pont-y-ty-pridd’, or ‘bridge by the earthen house’, not such an attractive title for a painting. So, poor Ibbetson was one of the first to be deceived by the mischievous mistranslation of a Welsh place name to impress an English visitor.\n\nEdwards’ famous bridge was painted by two generations of landscape artists, from Richard Wilson to Turner. It is the reason why there are more paintings of Pontypridd than of any other town in the South Wales valleys except Merthyr Tydfil.\n\nFortunately, the early popularity of this one subject seems to have inspired generations of local artists to paint the town, its people and its landscape through the changes of the last 200 years. Equally fortunately, a good selection of these works was collected by successive local librarians, and their transfer from Pontypridd Library to the Museum, followed by some new acquisitions, has given us a small but worthwhile collection.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"pontypriddmuseum.cymru/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SW_PIDD_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.ccc.ox.ac.uk/","uuid":"corpus-christi-college-university-of-oxford-7511","properties":{"title":"Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.253738,51.7508902],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The College has a modest collection of items, largely connected with its own history, which have generally been presented to it over the years.

It was originally built for George Villiers (1628–1687), 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Its proximity to the royal castle of Windsor and the racecourse at Ascot have ensured its succession of rich and noble owners. \n\nEvidently it was a grand enough mansion to be let to Frederick (1707–1751), Prince of Wales, estranged son of George II (1683–1760), and his wife Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719–1772), from 1739.

In 1795 it was razed to the ground by fire and the grand pile we see today was designed by Sir Charles Barry in 1850 for George Leveson-Gower (1786–1861), 2nd Duke of Sutherland. It was subsequently owned by the very rich Duke of Westminster. It was sold by him in 1893 to the American multi-millionaire, William Waldorf Astor (1848–1919), 1st Viscount Astor, who had been US Minister in Rome for a decade, where he collected not only decorative and fine art and sculpture, both Antique and modern, but pieces of architecture including the travertine marble balustrade from the Villa Borghese in Rome. \n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son Waldorf (1879–1952), 2nd Viscount Astor, who in 1906 had married the Virginian divorcee, Nancy Langhorne (1879–1964).

The collection was the inspiration of Anthony Emery, a mature undergraduate who came to Pembroke to read History following his return from the Second World War. Upon his arrival at Pembroke College in 1947 Emery suggested to his fellow students that he would like to establish a student art collection which would provide the Junior Common Room with good modern pictures and a measure of patronage for modern British artists who yet had to achieve fame. The Collection’s raison d’etre came to include the hire of pictures by members of the JCR for display in their rooms. This was not simply to decorate but to educate. Demand was so high amongst the students that a lottery system had to be set in place. The fact that the JCR enthusiastically embraced Emery’s idea is almost as extraordinary as the idea itself.

It was originally two storeys high and constructed as a tower house to impress and show off the family’s status. By the 1550s two wooden cruck frame wings were built beside, but not attached to, the tower. More extensions were added in the early seventeenth century as well as a third storey to the Tower. The Orrells’ fortunes waned by 1628, and they sold the tower to Humphrey Chetham, who became an absentee landlord renting the tower back to the Orrells. Chetham’s successors made some small alterations to the tower but none of note and during the Georgian period the house was largely tenanted and there was a period of low investment in the property. \n\nWith the acquisition of the property in 1835 by James Kay, an industrialist, the property took on a new lease of life. The property was rationalised and enlarged and the interior was fitted out in a more commodious style, using salvaged and new materials in the Gothic style. The Kays added the Mock Elizabethan wing.\n\nThe early twentieth century saw the arrival of Sir Lees Knowles and his wife Nina, who used the house as a weekend retreat. Lady Nina gifted the property in 1931 to Turton Urban District Council (TUDC), following the death of her husband, with the condition that it was used for public benefit of the local community. The property has remained in local authority control since then, being used firstly as council offices and meeting rooms, and then progressively being changed to a historic house museum.\n\nThe property is currently owned and managed by Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council through a Charitable Funds Committee, which seeks to ensure that Lady Nina’s wishes are adhered to.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"turtontower.co.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/TURT_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://museums.calderdale.gov.uk/","uuid":"bankfield-museum-3700","properties":{"title":"Bankfield Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.863295,53.732601],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Bankfield Museum was the home of Edward Akroyd, prominent local mill owner, from 1837–1886.

The most notable portrait in the collection post dates Williams' efforts though; the Hospital marked the retirement of its preeminent surgeon, William Cadge, in 1890 by commissioning a portrait painted by Sir Hubert von Herkomer.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/leaves-261223"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/NFK_NNH_location_image_2.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://twitter.com/UniOfHull","uuid":"university-of-hull-4068","properties":{"title":"University of Hull"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.3331619,53.7462633],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"twitter.com/UniOfHull"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/HUAC_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museums/museum-of-lancashire/","uuid":"museum-of-lancashire-6204","properties":{"title":"Museum of Lancashire"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.6882694,53.761286],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The Museum of Lancashire is based in an historic Grade II listed former court house building, on the outskirts of Preston town centre.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.lancashire.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/museums/museum-of-lancashire/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/LAN_LCMS_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-allan-r-bretherick-lord-mayor-19691970-32795","uuid":"leeds-civic-hall-4727","properties":{"title":"Leeds Civic Hall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.5485215,53.802202],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-allan-r-bretherick-lord-mayor-19691970-32795"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/WYL_LCH_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.scotborders.gov.uk/museums","uuid":"museum-gallery-service-headquarters-scottish-borders-council-7368","properties":{"title":"Museum & Gallery Service Headquarters, Scottish Borders Council"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.8389803,55.5487564],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.scotborders.gov.uk/museums"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SS_SBCO_location_image_5.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and-galleries/clydebank-museum/","uuid":"west-dunbartonshire-libraries-and-cultural-services-clydebank-museum-and-art-gallery-7004","properties":{"title":"West Dunbartonshire Libraries and Cultural Services: Clydebank Museum and Art Gallery"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.4093363,55.901645],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>West Dunbartonshire Council manages Clydebank Museum and Art Gallery, and preserves and promotes the rich local history through care of its museum collections and archives.

It was bought by the well-known actress Dame Ellen Terry (1847–1928) in 1899 and is full of memorabilia of her profession. She was encouraged to buy Smallhythe by her acting partner, Sir Henry Irving (1838–1905), with whom she shared the stage for 24 years, playing many parts, from Ophelia to his Hamlet to Portia to his Shylock.\n\nEllen Terry was first immortalised in art before she ever attained great fame on the stage. Her first husband, George Frederic Watts (1817–1904), painted her in the symbolic ‘Choosing’ (now in the National Portrait Gallery, London) where she is seen in the act of sniffing a camellia whilst holding the sweeter-smelling violets. He had wanted her to give up the idea of acting. He painted her again in ‘Watchman, What of the Night?’, now on private loan to Smallhythe. Originally titled ‘Joan of Arc’, he finished it after she had left him in 1867. The new title alludes to a passage in the biblical book of Isaiah: ‘the morning comes for those who inquire and repent, the night for those who do not’. The couple finally divorced in 1877. \n\nShe had two children, Edith ‘Edy’ Ailsa Craig and Edward Gordon Craig, with the architect Edward Godwin, who had built a house for them at Fallows Green, Harpenden before disappearing. After Ellen’s death, her daughter transformed the barn into a theatre, establishing the Barn Theatre Society. By 1939, she gave Smallhythe to the National Trust, whilst preserving a life interest. In her last years Edith lived in  a ménage à trois with the artists Chris St John (Christabel Marshall) and Clare Atwood, known as ‘Tony’, whose pictures remain at the property, including the portrait of their neighbour Vita Sackville-West in Ellen’s Portia costume, which she once borrowed for the Shakespeare masque at Knole in 1910.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.nationaltrust.org.uk/smallhythe-place/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SMAP_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/drummond-m7-class-044-tank-engine-40806","uuid":"community-heritage-access-centre-4630","properties":{"title":"Community Heritage Access Centre"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.558222,51.041143],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The paintings, which are part of the collections belonging to South Somerset District Council, are kept at the Community Heritage Access Centre at Lufton in Yeovil.

The paintings can be viewed by making an appointment using the contact details supplied at the back of this book. The Council also runs the Museum of South Somerset in the centre of Yeovil.\n\nThe origin of these collections lay in a museum inspired by Alderman W. R. E. Mitchelmore, Mayor of Yeovil 1918–1921. Further support from Alderman Henry Stiby and Mr William Wyndham enabled the town to provide a museum above the former public library in King George Street, in 1928. In 1965 the museum and collections transferred to its present site in the Old Coach House of Hendford Manor. In 1991 the museum was extensively refurbished before being renamed the Museum of South Somerset.\n\nThe oil paintings form a small part of the art collections and mainly comprise illustrations of Somerset scenes and portraits of people associated with South Somerset, together with works by artists connected with the district by birth or residence.\n\nOf particular note are a group of portraits depicting the members of prominent glover’s families. These include Thomas Dampier (1801–1876) and his wife Elizabeth Dampier (1807–1881), who also was the daughter of William Bide, another local glover. Portraits of Thomas William Dampier-Bide (1844–1916) and Elizabeth Dampier-Bide (1840–1915) continue the tradition. Gloving was one of Yeovil and South Somerset’s main industries up until the early twentieth century. These paintings are one of a suite of significant collections including hand tools, machinery, patterns, archives, photographs and gloves, held at the Community Heritage Access Centre, which record the heritage of the gloving industry or ‘Great Trade’ as it has been described locally.\n\nDavid Hill, Visitor Services Manager, South Somerset District Council</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/drummond-m7-class-044-tank-engine-40806"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk","uuid":"hampshire-cultural-trusts-winchester-store-3570","properties":{"title":"Hampshire Cultural Trust’s Winchester Store"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.3113279,51.0610722],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/barhams-brickyard-bridgwater-39753","uuid":"blake-museum-3773","properties":{"title":"Blake Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.0016435,51.127114],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/barhams-brickyard-bridgwater-39753"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/topsail-schooner-commodore-88959","uuid":"gravesham-borough-council-civic-centre-3354","properties":{"title":"Gravesham Borough Council, Civic Centre"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.3685517,51.4400503],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The oil paintings within this collection have come into council ownership mainly through donations to record the deeds of local prominent citizens and to celebrate important events and occasions.

The architect was probably the Dutch-born gentleman amateur Captain William Winde (before 1647–1722). It was built by Sir William Craven (1608–1697), 1st Earl of Craven. Legend would have it he built it for Elizabeth of Bohemia (1596–1662), the ‘Winter Queen’, to whom Craven was devoted but who died before it was completed.\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of James I, and wife of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who for one brief season in 1619–1620 was the crowned King of Bohemia, before being exiled in the Netherlands by the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II. Her youngest daughter Sophia married the future Elector of Hanover in 1658 and their son became George I.

Sir Winston Churchill visited, and George VI, who was a personal friend of the Clinton family (previous owners of the house), spent part of his honeymoon there.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Bicton House was set up as a Farm Institute to train ex-servicemen and women in agriculture as part of a rehabilitation programme. Academic staff welcomed students of Bicton’s first six-month course in 1947.\n\n1993 brought the most significant event in the College’s history since its foundation. Bicton College was taken out of the control of Devon County Council following the Further and Higher Education Act of 1992 and became a Further Education Corporation and an Exempt Charity with a new smaller Board of Governors.\n\nThe range of academic programmes currently offered covers: Agriculture, Animal Care, Arboriculture, Business Studies, Countryside Management, Engineering and Mechanisation, Equine Studies, Floristry, Horticulture, Outdoor Leisure, Sports Studies and Veterinary Nursing.\n\nThe College does not have an Art Department; however, accredited art courses began in 2005 within the School of Contemporary Floristry. Watercolours, working with mixed media, encaustic painting and latterly fibre arts (felt-making) have been taught, with a number of students progressing to higher education in art or textiles. An Art Summer School was held in 2007 for the first time and in 2010 the first exhibition of work produced in (residential student) art classes was held. The College grounds, arboretum, schools of horticulture and floristry are inspirational for a diverse range of artists – from botanical to abstract. In 2007, a Final Year Exhibition (Foundation Degree) of Environmental Arts and Crafts took place.\n\nCurrent oil and acrylic paintings owned by the college include: a George Deakins, 'Village Scene', presented to the College by students in 1967; by A. Debeuf, 'Woodland in Sunset', which is believed to be a scene of Woodbury Common; two large oil paintings of cattle and sheep on loan from the artist, Shannon Miller, that grace the upper grand staircase; and a student contemporary work in acrylic that hangs in the Principal’s outer office. Other commissioned acrylic paintings hanging in the Library and Refectory are the work of the current tutor, Gill Burbidge. Influenced by the work of Reg Cartwright, these colourful, textural canvases were created with young people and a ‘healthy eating’ theme in mind.

Original plans for Parliament Buildings actually involved three separate buildings to include law courts, a parliamentary building, and an administrative block. However, due to rising costs early in the project, the original plans were changed and only one building was constructed. This explains why it is called ‘Parliament Buildings’ (plural) even though it is single standalone building. The intended sites for the other two buildings are clearly visible today, these are the lower terraces in front, and to either side of Parliament Buildings. Parliament Buildings is one of the best-known and most striking pieces of architecture in Northern Ireland.

Work on the new Council House was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War and it was not until several years after the war, when the economic climate improved, that the building work continued. The Council House was finally finished in 1953 and was officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1956. The ceiling of the Conference Hall, the work of Tom Monnington, is one of the largest painted ceilings in the country and the geometrical design was inspired by the symbol of atomic physics. The adjoining Council Chamber also has a very fine ceiling, by John Armstrong and Mary Collet, on the theme of Bristol throughout its history. Both ceilings were gifts from the Edwin Austin Memorial Fund. Set apart from these two large halls is the Civic Suite which comprises Committee Rooms, the Lord Mayors Parlour and Reception Room, a sitting room for women councillors and a retiring room. The Council House is the home of the city’s municipal treasurers. The Lord Mayor's Parlour houses the civic insignia, chief among which are four ceremonial swords: the Mourning Sword, dating from about 1373; the Pearl Sword from the late fourteenth century; the Lent Sword from the fifteenth century and the eighteenth-century State Sword. The eight silver maces are now carried in procession by police officers and the city treasurer has a seventeenth-century copper gift mace.

He commissioned the fashionable architect, Ernest George, to extend the existing early nineteenth-century villa with a huge conservatory and an Italianate tower, which overlooked the High Weald towards the South Downs. When the estate was inherited in 1915 by Leonard Messel (1872–1953), Ludwig’s eldest son, he and his wife Maud Sambourne (1875–1960) created a romantic, pseudo-medieval manor house, under the guidance of Sir Walter Tapper and Norman Evill, although much was lost in a fire in 1947. \n\nToday the pictures that remain were mostly acquired at a sale of chattels from Nymans in 1994, or were accepted in lieu of tax a year later.

Some of these specimens, including some of the Galapagos finches, found their way to the University Museum of Zoology.\n\nThe University Museum of Zoology is open to the public and admission is free. We are open Monday–Friday 10am–4.45pm, and Saturday 11am–4pm. Not all paintings are on display. If you want to see a particular painting, please contact the collection.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/CU_ZOO_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/georgiana-millicent-wife-of-the-2nd-baron-hindlip-53962","uuid":"west-mercia-police-force-headquarters-4599","properties":{"title":"West Mercia Police Force Headquarters"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.1751191,52.2253208],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/georgiana-millicent-wife-of-the-2nd-baron-hindlip-53962"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/HSW_WMP_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/loss-of-the-martina-maria-january-1881-12193","uuid":"southwold-sailors-reading-room-4481","properties":{"title":"Southwold Sailors' Reading Room"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.6814616,52.3256671],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/loss-of-the-martina-maria-january-1881-12193"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SFK_SWR_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.oswestry-tc.gov.uk","uuid":"oswestry-guildhall-3215","properties":{"title":"Oswestry Guildhall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.0548125,52.8608958],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Oswestry Town Council holds a modest collection of paintings that has links to the Oswestry area.

It was then acquired by Sir Richard Cust (1680–1734), 2nd Bt of Pinchbeck, in the year of his death, becoming the dower-house of his widow, née Anne Brownlow, until she succeeded to National Trust, Belton House, on the death of her brother, Viscount Tyrconnel, in 1754. In 1884, Emma Hutchinson (1857–1936), Mrs Sedgwick, became a tenant, and in 1921 it was bought by her brother, James Hutchinson, Earl Brownlow’s agent, who bequeathed it to her three years later. She left it to her daughters, Miss Winifred and Miss Marion Sedgwick, who gave it and its contents to the National Trust between 1944 and 1950, along with 20 acres, thus preserving an important green space in the centre of the town, known as 'Sedgwick Meadows'. \n\nThe house was subsequently tenanted by Margaret Thatcher’s election agent, Major-General Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith (1913–2005) and Molly Cayzer (1917–2001), Lady Wyldbore-Smith. Amongst the few pictures are three large still lifes of flowers and fruit that were probably once overdoors at Belton House and, something of a rarity, 'A Kitchen Scene' by Pieter Aertsen, dated 1563, recently re-revealed after a breakthrough restoration by the Hamilton Kerr Institute.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.nationaltrust.org.uk/Grantham-House/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/NTIII_GRAN_location_image_2.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://nantwichmuseum.org.uk/","uuid":"nantwich-museum-5177","properties":{"title":"Nantwich Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.5206607,53.06571],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The Collection comprises scenes of Nantwich life in past centuries by the Nantwich artist, Herbert St John Jones; two paintings by unknown artists of two notable local figures; an eighteenth-century painting of a racehorse on Nantwich racecourse and a twentieth-century painting by a local artist of the town's square. \n\nThere is an artist’s impression of the sixteenth-century fire of Nantwich and buildings and people in Hospital Street and by the Crown hotel.

This new house offered the space they needed for their growing family, a parlour where they could entertain guests and even a small study in which Burns could write. Robert Burns only spent three years here. He died in July 1796, and was buried close by in St Michael’s churchyard on the same day that Jean gave birth to their ninth child. His death left her a widow, at just 31 years old. Jean remained in the house in Mill Street, and the house became a monument to her late husband – a place where those who admired his work could visit and pay their respects. She lived there herself for another 38 years, until her death in 1834. In 1903 the Town Council of Dumfries took on the lease of Burns House. Working with Dumfries Burns Club they improved the arrangements for viewing the house. The core of a museum collection on Robert Burns was begun and the larger of the two bedrooms was set out as a museum. Dumfries Burns Club contributed their items to the display, and after an appeal other collectors added their objects to the exhibition. Today Robert Burns House is part of Dumfries and Galloway Museums Service, and is run by Dumfries and Galloway Council. The house gives a picture of how the poet and his family lived in the late eighteenth century, and visitors can see his desk and chair in the study where he wrote his best known poems. Also on display are the famous Kilmarnock and Edinburgh editions of his work along with many original manuscripts and belongings of the poet and his family.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.dumgal.gov.uk/article/15733/Robert-Burns-House"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/DGD_location_image_3.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.arranmuseum.co.uk/","uuid":"isle-of-arran-heritage-museum-7341","properties":{"title":"Isle of Arran Heritage Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.1607198,55.5832457],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.arranmuseum.co.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SS_IAHM_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/Home.aspx","uuid":"dean-castle-7325","properties":{"title":"Dean Castle"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.4838995,55.6232507],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The Castle takes its name from 'The Dean' or wooded valley – a common place name in Scotland.

It was bought in 1861 by Charles Seely (1803–1887).

It was inherited by his son, Major General John ‘Jack’ Seely (1868–1947), 1st Baron Mottistone, who in turn passed it to his heir and namesake, the 2nd Baron (1899–1963).  He and his business partner, Paul Paget (1901–1985), were the architects responsible for the remodeling of the whole house in the 1920s.

The two highlights at Mottistone are undoubtedly the two portraits by Gilbert Joseph Holiday: ‘General Jack Seely (1868–1947), 1st Baron Mottistone on His Horse, “Warrior” (1908–1941)’; and ‘The Seely Family on Horseback, on a Moor’ – a striking image that emulates that of Sir Alfred Munnings in the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, in which they are shown looking out to sea from the Island’s cliff tops. The lifetime of the 1st Baron’s horse rivaled that of its fictional counterpart in Michael Morpurgo’s ‘War Horse’.  He survived four years at war, fighting at the Somme and Ypres, and lead one of the last ever cavalry charges against the Germans at Amiens in 1918.  He cheated death on numerous occasions and recuperated from the war on the Island.

Maggie's is about empowering people to live with, through and beyond cancer by bringing together professional help, communities of support and building design to create exceptional centres for cancer care.\n\nWe have a collection of over 1000 drawings, paintings, prints and sculptures. The collection boasts some pieces by key British artists such as Grayson Perry, Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley. This collection is spread across the fifteen Maggie's centres throughout the UK.\n\nMaggie's Fife, which was designed by the award-winning architect Zaha Hadid, is situated in the grounds of the Victoria Hospital in Fife. The building work started in November 2005 and finished in October 2006. Dr John Wilson, Consultant Physician, Fife Acute Hospitals said: 'A casual observer might think, from the outside, that Maggie's Fife was a bit dark and slightly forbidding but from the inside it is almost the opposite. It's light, it's curved and has got an outlook with lots of natural light coming in. In my more fanciful moments, I’ve thought that might be a metaphor. Cancer when it looms in your life looks pretty black and forbidding but it looks different from the inside. The building in a sense has a parallel with the cancer journey.'\n\nAnyone affected by cancer is welcome to drop in to the centre for a cup of tea and a chat, to browse the library or to access one of its courses. Maggie's Fife was designed to create a relaxed atmosphere, which includes pieces of art displayed throughout the centre. Maggie Keswick Jencks, the co-founder of Maggie's, was friends with contemporary artists including Eduardo Paolozzi, and so art in many Maggie's Centres is integrated with the design and atmosphere of the building.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.maggiescentres.org/centres/fife.html"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/MCK_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/bar-cockburn-street-124559","uuid":"fife-house-glenrothes-5120","properties":{"title":"Fife House, Glenrothes"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.176453,56.1974868],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Fife House is a major administrative centre for Fife Council.\r\n\r\nThis venue and its collections are directly managed by Fife Council. </p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/bar-cockburn-street-124559"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/csf-fife-location-image-7-1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_013&","uuid":"arbroath-abbey-5318","properties":{"title":"Arbroath Abbey"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.5832897,56.5619438],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Arbroath Abbey was founded in 1178 for monks of the Tironensian order by King William the Lion.

After some time, the hospital granted the Museum the use of the balcony overlooking the dining hall at Glenside. The collection gradually built up, as people donated artefacts. When the Hospital closed in 1994, the use of the derelict chapel was given to the Museum. The chapel was in a very poor state of disrepair, all of the stained glass windows were boarded up and the interior had become home to pigeons and squirrels. The volunteers set to work scrubbing the floors, removing the pews and taking down the boards from the windows so that they could be seen once again. The museum gradually developed with Dr Early as the guiding light, forming the exhibits and telling the story of the Hospital. The volunteers were saddened when Dr Early was robbed of his power of speech due to a stroke. With the help of Dr Peter Carpenter, Dr Early's dream of publishing a book depicting the history of Glenside Hospital was finally realised shortly before his death in 2004.

The College and its students represent an important part of Oxford. It is incredible to think that just 21 years ago, someone wanting to take a postgraduate degree while continuing with their careers or other responsibilities couldn’t return – or come – to Oxford. Kellogg has opened the scholarship of Oxford to audiences who could never otherwise have benefited. And it has allowed Oxford to fish in a bigger talent pool to get the best students, no longer limited to those able to quit their jobs and careers and return to being full-time residential students – and Oxford is the better for it’.\n\nThe College is home not only to students but to a number of research centres.

Elements of the Great Garden, the largest surviving part of Shakespeare’s estate, will be conserved and further developed over time.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.shakespeare.org.uk/visit/shakespeares-new-place/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/surgeon-parker-b-1788-53993","uuid":"the-city-art-gallery-museum-the-worcestershire-regimental-museum-4613","properties":{"title":"The City Art Gallery & Museum, The Worcestershire Regimental Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.2222028,52.1964722],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/surgeon-parker-b-1788-53993"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/WMAG_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/portal/","uuid":"cambridge-guildhall-3812","properties":{"title":"Cambridge Guildhall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.1193167,52.2046916],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/portal/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/BCN_CACC_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-disappearance-of-all-saints-church-dunwich-suffolk-10743","uuid":"dunwich-museum-3925","properties":{"title":"Dunwich Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.6304628,52.2774872],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-disappearance-of-all-saints-church-dunwich-suffolk-10743"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/SFK_DUN_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-r-b-jackson-d-1955-53639","uuid":"bewdley-guildhall-3809","properties":{"title":"Bewdley Guildhall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.3147207,52.3757616],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-r-b-jackson-d-1955-53639"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/HSW_BWC_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/hedging-and-ditching-55923","uuid":"exhall-grange-specialist-school-science-college-3950","properties":{"title":"Exhall Grange Specialist School & Science College"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.508614,52.4554727],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/hedging-and-ditching-55923"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.sandwell.gov.uk/info/200070/museums_and_galleries/11/haden_hill_house_museum_and_haden_ol","uuid":"haden-hill-house-3449","properties":{"title":"Haden Hill House"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.062211,52.4677743],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.sandwell.gov.uk/info/200070/museums_and_galleries/11/haden_hill_house_museum_and_haden_ol"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/collection/PUBSCULPT/STF/STF_WEDSD_location_image_3.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.hajc.leics.sch.uk/","uuid":"hinckley-academy-and-john-cleveland-sixth-form-centre-4082","properties":{"title":"Hinckley Academy and John Cleveland Sixth Form Centre"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.3533863,52.5454816],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.hajc.leics.sch.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/LLR_JCC_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/costessey-stick-bridge-norfolk-92","uuid":"the-costessey-centre-3869","properties":{"title":"The Costessey Centre"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.2071754,52.6572427],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The paintings at Costessey Centre are currently in storage.

The Museum has a comprehensive range of Edwardian postcards which numbers several hundred recording events, buildings, crime, the castle and other important social themes.\n \nThree significant items in the collection are 'Haverfordwest Priory' by Samuel Prout (c.1835) (watercolour), 'Haverfordwest Castle', by William Pitt (1872) and the charter of freedom of the borough granted to Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1802.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.haverfordwest-town-museum.org.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/NWM_HVM_collection_image_2.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.braintree.gov.uk/Braintree/leisure-culture/BDMS/Museum/default.htm","uuid":"braintree-district-museum-3748","properties":{"title":"Braintree District Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.5537432,51.8782825],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.braintree.gov.uk/Braintree/leisure-culture/BDMS/Museum/default.htm"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/collection_photos/ESX_BDM_collection_image_2.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-john-hopkins-17501828-3520","uuid":"harwich-guildhall-4035","properties":{"title":"Harwich Guildhall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.2876087,51.9460696],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/alderman-john-hopkins-17501828-3520"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/ESX_HGH_location_image_2.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/john-winchcombe-14891557-63022","uuid":"winchcombe-town-hall-5269","properties":{"title":"Winchcombe Town Hall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.9642164,51.9533105],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>Winchcombe's Victorian Town Hall was completely rebuilt in 1853 and extended in 1871.

There is a fine portrait of him by Arthur Trevethin Nowell. The chair of Systematics and Pastoral Theology was held by the first principal, Dr Henry Maldwyn Hughes, from 1921 to 1937. He was the author of several works on Christian belief and his portrait by Frank Salisbury hangs with that of Reverend Robert Newton Flew, who succeeded Hughes both as principal and professor. Flew, Principal from 1937 to 1955, was one of the moving forces behind the establishment of the World Council of Churches. The three-sided court fronted by iron gates and railings was enclosed in 1973 by a new building housing flats for married students and a lecture theatre.\n\nIt is stressed that the paintings at Wesley House are not in public ownership.

The first museum to celebrate this unique salty heritage opened its doors in Northwich town centre in 1889 but became a victim of subsidence a few years later. A second library and museum opened its doors in the same area in 1909 following the stabilisation of the land. There were also periods when the collection was packed away in store and it was not until the early 1970s that there was renewed interest in it. The collection was reinstated on the first floor of Northwich Library in 1974. \n\nAround the same time, Cheshire County Council was busy restoring the old Northwich Workhouse in London Road to its former glory, to house the fledgling Cheshire Museums Service. It was decided that the building could also serve as the new Salt Museum and so the salt collection moved here and opened its doors in 1981. Cheshire Museums Service began to acquire notable material from across the county, including works of art and archaeology, and this collection was eventually merged with the Salt Museum collection. Since then, the museum has broadened its approach and collected material relating to the social history of mid-Cheshire.\n\nIn 2010 the Salt Museum (now run by Cheshire West and Chester Council) was renamed Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse, in order to better reflect its aim of becoming the museum uncovering the wider history of the area. Much of the old Salt Museum collection will be reinstated at the Lion Salt Works in Marston, which is currently being restored as an exciting new visitor attraction.

It was founded in 1823 as a forum for discussion and debate, at a time when the free exchange of ideas was a notion foreign to the restrictive University authorities. It soon became the only place for students to discuss political topics whilst at Oxford. W. E.

Gladstone was President of the Union in 1830, shortly before entering the House of Commons.

Anne, later Shakespeare’s wife, was born in the cottage in 1556.\n\nWhen the site was a farm it was known as ‘Hewlands’ and the Hathaway family were very successful sheep farmers. The garden would have been a farmyard with some livestock and likely a herb garden.\n\nAfter the death of Anne’s father in 1581, Anne’s brother Bartholomew inherited the tenancy of the 90-acre farm and later bought it freehold. He went on to make various improvements to the cottage including an extension. The first floor was inserted and the chimneys added at the same time. This work was completed before the death of Bartholomew in 1624.\n\nBy the late 1800s, the family’s fortunes were on the wane; some property including land and houses were mortgaged and eventually sold. In 1838, the cottage itself was sold and the remaining Hathaway family continued to live in the cottage as tenants. \n\nOne of the last Hathaways to live in the cottage was Mary Baker. When the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust purchased the cottage in 1892 from the then landlord, Mary and her family were paid the large wage of £75 per year. Their duties were to share family stories and to care for the cottage, both of which we continue to do today.

It tells the story of Dartmoor from pre-history to present time. Visitors can find out how Dartmoor was formed from molten magma millions of years ago. \n\nOkehampton, or ‘Oc mund tun’ as it was originally known, is rich in history. The original settlement began about 1089 and was built around the Parish Church on the hill but gradually it settled in the valley. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1623 and a couple of its buildings date from the 1600s. The Museum holds a fine collection of photographs and tithe maps of the area. The collection includes two thirteenth-century Okehampton Castle bells with a romantic inscription around them. A Bronze Age hut gives an idea of what it was like to live on Dartmoor, as does the wheelwright and blacksmith’s shop, the mine and Dartmoor cottage.

It passed through a variety of hands before being acquired in 1878 by G. P. Fuller, MP, of Neston Park and subsequently Major Robert Fuller (1875–1955), who restored it, using the sensitive local architect, Sir Harold Brakspear (who had also restored the cloisters at Lacock Abbey).

Some of these enter the DPhil programme and become part of our community for three years, joining a lively group of around 40 research students.

The Department incorporates the MRC Anatomical Neuropharmacology Unit and provides space and research support for approximately 180 scientists, including 50 graduate students and international visitors. The Department’s research is at the highest international level. Scientists are engaged in the investigation of basic questions concerning the interactions of chemical substances with biological systems, increasing our understanding of gene function in living organisms in the post-genomic age. The Department is a centre of excellence in calcium imaging. Intracellular calcium signals are the most ubiquitous of cellular control mechanisms. The role of the cyclic ADP ribose and NAADP as intracellular calcium mobilizing messengers is a central theme in projects spanning cardiovascular pharmacology to egg fertilization. Neuropharmacology is another focus, including the application of novel imaging techniques to the study of neurotransmitter release and action at receptors. As well as increasing fundamental understanding of biological processes (including memory), research in these areas provides the basis for developing novel drug targets for common neurological diseases, as does investigation of inflammation in the nervous system and a study of the role of individual receptor types in depression and addiction.

It was conceived and assembled by a group of interested firefighters who were keen not to let the service's proud heritage disappear. The Greater Manchester region has played an important role in the development of fire brigades and fire engineering over many years. Manchester had the first municipal fire service in England in 1826 and was also the first wholly-professional brigade. Eccles acquired the country's first motorised fire engine in 1901 and ever since, the area has been noted for innovation and progress within the field. The area – Salford in particular – was also a centre for the fire engineering industry, with fire engines, hose and ladders being made here and exported worldwide.\n \nThe Museum's collection includes several full-size fire appliances, equipment, uniforms, models, medals and insignia, some displayed in appropriate period settings. The earliest exhibit is a 1741 Newsham fire engine, whilst the largest is a 125ft Dennis-Metz turntable ladder appliance. Many of the larger, mechanical exhibits are maintained in working order. There is an extensive photographical archive of fires, emergency incidents, personnel and equipment, which also incorporates the Clifford C. Ashton collection. Other significant objects include items from the famous firefighting Tozer family.\n \nThe Museum is a registered charity which works in partnership with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, assisting the Brigade with its public relations and educational roles, particularly the engagement and teaching of younger visitors.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.manchesterfire.gov.uk/about_us/fire_museum.aspx"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/GFSM_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://museums.calderdale.gov.uk/","uuid":"smith-art-gallery-3705","properties":{"title":"Smith Art Gallery"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.7860734,53.7040321],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>This purpose-built Victorian Art Gallery is set in a small park on the edge of Brighouse, with good access to the motorway.

The collection has a particular emphasis on the town of Cirencester and the South Cotswolds.\n\nThe wealth of Cirencester from the middle ages to the eighteenth century was based on the wool trade. Many rich wool merchants lived in Cirencester and their influence can be seen in much of the town's beautiful architecture. They built expensive houses (the museum is situated in one) and their wealth contributed to the exquisite church and its unique South Porch, used as the Town Hall, now being restored with the help of National Lottery Heritage funding. One of these great wool merchants was John Coxwell (1516–1618) who was born in Cirencester. He profited from the dissolution of the great abbey in Cirencester, purchasing considerable property from Queen Elizabeth 1st to add to his estate in other parts of Gloucestershire. His town house was in Abbott Street, now called Coxwell Street, and was probably Woolgatherers. In 1614, at the age of 98, John Coxwell commissioned Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen to paint his portrait. In 2002 the painting was donated to the museum by Colonel Coxwell-Rogers, a descendant of John Coxwell.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"coriniummuseum.org"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/CODC_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/museums","uuid":"essex-regiment-museum-3290","properties":{"title":"Essex Regiment Museum"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.4614723,51.7227336],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The Essex Regiment Museum collection is owned by the Trustees of the Essex Regiment Museum and managed by Chelmsford Borough Council.

the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art has enjoyed a variety of guises, and a developing reputation. As Oxford’s first Slade Professor, Ruskin intended to develop a course for the University leading to a degree in art. Armed with a teaching collection of more than 800 watercolours and drawings and more than 400 prints, including works by Dürer, Tintoretto and J. M. W. Turner, the school was originally housed in the University Galleries. The school continued its work in what became the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, moving to its current High Street site in 1975. Ruskin’s dream of establishing a Bachelor of Fine Art degree was achieved in 1978, and this became the present honours degree in 1992. The Ruskin enjoys a special relationship with Oxford’s Department of the History of Art, which welcomed its first BA students in 2004, and with many other parts of the University, including the School of Anatomy, the Department of Engineering Science, the Institute of Archaeology and numerous museums. The rapport with Modern Art Oxford (MAO) is also extremely positive and Ruskin students have staged their own exhibitions and been involved in a number of projects with MAO.\n\nThe Department is not

It was built in 1475 in the reign of Edward IV. With his brother, John, William Browne was largely responsible for enlarging and embellishing the Church of All Saints' nearby. He and his wife are believed to have lived in a house adjacent to the western side of the Hospital, and so would have been parishioners of All Saints', where brasses to three generations of their family may be seen. \n\nIn 1485, William was authorised by letters patent of Richard III to found and endow the almshouse, but after his death and that of his wife, Margaret, in 1489, the management of the Hospital passed to her brother, Thomas Stokke, Canon of York and Rector of Easton-on-the-Hill, just outside Stamford. Stokke obtained new letters patent from Henry VII in 1493 and the chapel was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln on 22nd December, 1494. \n\nThe Hospital or Bedehouse – a name by which it was also known – was established as a home and a house of prayer for 10 poor men and two poor women, with a Warden and a Confrater, both of whom were to be secular, i.e. non-monastic, priests. The statutes required attendance at chapel twice daily, where masses for the repose of the souls of the Founders were said, but on Sundays it was to All Saints' Church that they had to go. The title 'bedesman' or 'beadsman', given to the poor men, was derived from the beads of the rosary. With the passage of time, a new charter became necessary and this was granted by James I in 1610, and thus Browne's Hospital may claim to be a Royal Foundation or Royal Hospital.\n\nVisitors may remember that Browne's Hospital featured as 'Middlemarch Hospital' in the film adaptation of George Eliot's novel, 'Middlemarch', much of which was shot in Stamford. The Hospital is today home to 12 residents as specified in the Foundation, but at present we have 10 ladies and two men. The cottages around the beautiful courtyard garden were updated in 1963 to flats, each with a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.\n\nThe Hospital is a Registered Charity, No. 221428, and is managed by a Board of Governors and Trustees, any profit from opening to the public goes towards maintaining this Foundation.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-common-room-at-brownes-hospital-81626"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/HOSWB_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.powys.gov.uk/","uuid":"welshpool-council-offices-6902","properties":{"title":"Welshpool Council Offices"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-3.1422088,52.6581264],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.powys.gov.uk/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.leics.gov.uk/index/leisure_tourism/libraries/county_libraries/a_to_z_libraries/charnwood_","uuid":"anstey-library-5258","properties":{"title":"Anstey Library"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.1901659,52.6731065],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.leics.gov.uk/index/leisure_tourism/libraries/county_libraries/a_to_z_libraries/charnwood_"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/LLR_LSLIB_location_image_1.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/colonel-the-honourable-robert-henry-clive-17981854-colonel-commanding-18351854-54004","uuid":"rhq-royal-mercian-lancastrian-yeomanry-3597","properties":{"title":"RHQ Royal Mercian & Lancastrian Yeomanry"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.4682524,52.676093],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"artuk.org/discover/artworks/colonel-the-honourable-robert-henry-clive-17981854-colonel-commanding-18351854-54004"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.leics.gov.uk/index/leisure_tourism/libraries/county_libraries/a_to_z_libraries/charnwood_","uuid":"birstall-library-5259","properties":{"title":"Birstall Library"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.1182737,52.6778546],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":""}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.leics.gov.uk/index/leisure_tourism/libraries/county_libraries/a_to_z_libraries/charnwood_"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/_source/LLR_LSLIB_location_image_3.jpg"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://www.derehammemorialhall.info/","uuid":"dereham-town-council-memorial-hall-7832","properties":{"title":"Dereham Town Council Memorial Hall"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.94545226,52.680346],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>A hub for theatre, live music and other cultural events in the town.</p>"}],"links":[{"type":"subjectOf","identifier":"www.derehammemorialhall.info/"}],"depictions":[{"@id":"artuk.org/skins/artuk/img/placeholder-venue.png"}]},{"type":"Feature","@id":"http://museumofcannockchase.org","uuid":"museum-of-cannock-chase-3428","properties":{"title":"Museum of Cannock Chase"},"types":[{"identifier":"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1007870","label":"art gallery"}],"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-1.990547,52.712195],"certainty":"certain"},"descriptions":[{"value":"<p>The Museum of Cannock Chase site was once the home to the Valley Colliery, the training pit for thousands of young men beginning their working lives in the local coal industry.

Newton was the son of another Isaac, who died before he was born, who was the son of a successful sheep farmer and lord of the manor, and Hannah Ayscough, the daughter of a local minor gentry family, who left him in the care of her mother when she remarried. He left at the age of 12, returning only once to escape the plague in Cambridge in 1665/1667. Yet, during this brief period, he discovered the principles of differential calculus, the laws governing planetary motion and succeeded in refracting light through a prism.
